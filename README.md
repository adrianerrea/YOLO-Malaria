# YOLO-Malaria

## Description

In the computational inteligence subject we got on the master's degree of computer science, we had to develop a deep learning system for a real world problem. After little searching I came up with this dataset in Kaggle about Malaria and I got interested on that topic so I went for it!

Here you can find all the details https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/malaria-bounding-boxes but I will explain briefly what the dataset and the context is like.

Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world causing 400000 deaths per year. The inspections of cells manually remains the gold standard for parasite detection and this could lead to human bias and poor performance caused by this laborious task. Automating this task is one of the remaining goals to achieve due to the lack of replication and comparision combined to the the absence of a gold standard and the negative of some researching centres to publish some images has made this process hard to accomplish.

In order to address this problem, the dataset provided contains 1364 images (around 80000 cells) from diferent researching centers divided in two different sets: train and test. The data is labelled in 6 classes: 2 type of uninfected cells and 4 type of infected cells (a "difficult" class is also appear when the annotators did not know the label). Besides this, a class label and a set of bounding boxes are given for each cell. So our main goal is to identify the type of cell and its coordinates for the test set provided.
