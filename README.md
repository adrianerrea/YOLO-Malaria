# YOLO-Malaria

## Description

In the computational inteligence subject we got on the master's degree of computer science, we had to develop a deep learning system for a real world problem. After little searching I came up with this competition in Kaggle about Malaria and I got interested on that topic so I went for it!

Here you can find all the details https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/malaria-bounding-boxes but I will explain briefly what the competition is like.
